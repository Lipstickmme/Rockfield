/**
 * The bank's public contact details, as one record.
 *
 * There are two places an operator can set these, for historical reasons the
 * site should not have to care about:
 *
 *   - the bank's staff console, under Settings, which writes the `settings`
 *     collection and therefore works on JSON files as well as on Supabase;
 *   - the client services desk at /admin, which writes the `site_settings`
 *     table directly and needs Supabase.
 *
 * The console wins where it has a value, because it is the one that works
 * everywhere. Whatever it leaves blank falls through to the desk, and then to
 * the built-in defaults in src/data/site.json - which are themselves blank for
 * the address and the telephone numbers. Nothing here invents a value: a
 * detail nobody has set comes back as '' and the page leaves its row out.
